# Evolving artificial sign languages in the lab

The files in this repository include data files and analysis for data across 3 experiments of a study that looks at the roles that interaction between language users and transmission of language to new users play in the evolution of systematic linguistic structure.

## Data files

There are separate data files for experiments 1, 2 and 3.


## Analysis notebooks

The analysis notebooks are Jupyter Notebooks that run a Python 2.7 kernel and an R kernel. Analysis is divided into three notebooks. 

* Efficiency results
* Systematicity results
* Supplementary results
